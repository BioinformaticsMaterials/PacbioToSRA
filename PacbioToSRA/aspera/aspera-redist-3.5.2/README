Notes:
1. This package contains the binaries for several platforms. You can ignore
   the ones you do not need.
2. The included license is a web-client license and requires Aspera Connect 
   Server to perform transfers. Contact Aspera for other licenses.
3. Aspera's executables depend on some libraries to run. These libraries are 
   placed next the exectuables in this package and must always be deployed 
   along with the executables.
